LotteryNumbers

Program asks the user to enter the total number of lottery balls then the
amount of balls that are drawn. Program checks that the user input is correct:
Both amounts, total and drawn balls, are positive numbers and that the amount
of total balls is greater than the amount of drawn balls. Program counts the
probability for the player to guess all the drawn balls correctly.
